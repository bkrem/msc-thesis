abstract = {Proof of stake is a consensus mechanism for digital currencies that is an alternative to proof of work used in Bitcoin. The main declared advantages of proof of stake approaches are the absence of expensive computations and hence a lower entry barrier for block generation rewards. In this report, we examine the pros and cons of both consensus systems and show that existing implemen-tations of proof of stake are vulnerable to attacks which are highly unlikely in Bitcoin and proof of work approaches in general.},

@article{Usher2013,
abstract = {This summary report by the Center on Education Policy (CEP) pulls together findings from a wide array of studies on student motivation by scholars in a range of disciplines, as well as lessons from programs around the country intended to increase motivation. It is intended to start a conversation about the importance of motivation and the policies and practices that might better engage students in learning. The information in this summary is distilled from a series of six background papers by CEP, available at www.cep-dc.org. The background papers focus on the following aspects of student motivation: (1) What is motivation and why does it matter? (2) Can money or other rewards motivate students? (3) Can goals motivate students? (4) What roles do parent involvement, family background, and culture play in student motivation? (5) What can schools do to motivate students? (6) What nontraditional approaches can motivate unenthusiastic students? Most of the findings in this summary are based on multiple sources, for which the specific citations can be found in the appropriate CEP background paper for that topic. Where a particular study, statistic, or quotation is referred to in this summary, the source is cited and included in the reference list at the end of this paper.},

@article{Temperini2008,
abstract = {Our on-line students, being mainly busy worker-students, study almost alone. To improve their interaction we use asynchronous tools (Wiki or forums), but we notice that interaction becomes high mainly when the discussion is focused on a task to be graded for the exam or when the teacher/tutor is very active in the community. We present SOCIALX, our exercise sharing tool, an application to e-learning of a simple reputation system to increase the student motivation and interaction, and to let them learning from each other, either by reusing other's solutions or by correcting other's mistakes. Moreover, students gain reputation from others reusing their solutions. In this we want to engage students in learning activities at the highest cognitive levels of the Bloom taxonomy.},

@article{Sterbini2009,
abstract = {We present the design issues and motivations of an enhanced version of the web-based system SOCIALX, supporting collaborative and social aspects of learning. This web application allows to share solutions to exercises and development of project- (possibly group-) work, through the management of a reputation system. With the aim of enhancing collaboration and to help students working on exercises, we introduce contextual FAQs and micro-forums and a currency-based concretization of the perceived usefulness of other's answers. The tokens exchanged are used also to help the teacher/tutor in choosing the best question/answer pairs to be promoted to the FAQ. To introduce group responsibilities, peer-pressure and self-evaluation we define group-based projects with self/peer-evaluated phases. The different phases of a project are given to different groups, so that the produced deliverables are both self-evaluated when they are submitted and peer-evaluated by the group working on the next phase. The system is its last stages of development and will be tested with real students in the next academic year.},
