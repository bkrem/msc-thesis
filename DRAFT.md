## 1.1 Problem Outline
Motivation is the key to human action. Without it, the source of any action performed is likely to be grounded in external pressures rather than the actorâ€™s desire to act. In adolescents and young adults, this situation frequently arises within a key element affecting their future: their education.

This project began as an attempt to address this phenomenon of student disengagement and, over time, developed into a wholly larger investigation of whether it is possible to utilise blockchain technology not just to form a network of re-engaged students, but as a tool for the verification of group-based work at large.
