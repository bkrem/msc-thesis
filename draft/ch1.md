## 1.1 Problem Outline
Motivation is the key to human action. Without it, the source of any action performed is likely to be grounded in external pressures rather than the actorâ€™s desire to act. In adolescents and young adults, this situation frequently arises within a key element affecting their future: their education.

## 1.2 Project Goals
This project began as an attempt to address this phenomenon of student disengagement and, over time, developed into a wholly larger investigation of whether it is possible to utilise blockchain technology not just to form a network of re-engaged students, but as a tool for the verification of group-based work at large.  
The major goals of the project were thus twofold: in a broader sense, to demonstrate how the properties of a blockchain can be leveraged in a social, communal context, rather than the financial contexts they are usually applied to, and more concretely, to create a free, open and extensible platform for students of all ages to re-engage with their peers in a productive, educational manner, underpinned by a model of motivation which rewards collaborative work as a team.  

Working from this technological and philosophical objective, respectively, the following goals were established for the project:
- Create a public Application Programming Interface (henceforth API) to allow users to interact with a blockchain in a well-defined manner, independent of a chosen client-side implementation.
- Provide an iOS client-side app for basic task/user/team management to provide maximum accessibility and familiarity for users.
- Establish a basic deployment of at least 4 distributed validator nodes to provide a true proof-of-stake consensus mechanism _[REF]()_ for the platform.

## 1.3 Personal Aims
**TODO: Blurb**  
Having been a follower of the bitcoin _[REF]()_ movement for more than two years, the author has been looking for an appropriate opportunity to apply the blockchain data structure, which is a key part of the technology underlying bitcoin, to a project of his own. This project's goal of verifiability of team work fits a blockchain's ability to provide a pseudo-anonymous public ledger of transactions or events.  

The following points provide an overview of the author's personal aims for the project:
- Become familiar with native mobile app development by utilising existing JavaScript knowledge in the context of React Native _[REF]()_.
- Learn how to write smart contracts in Solidity _[REF]()_ that are useful in the context of the project and for existing platforms such as Ethereum _[REF]()_.
- Implement a form of blockchain technology, by learning how to set up, run & maintain a a blockchain proficiently.
- Gain a fundamental understanding of Docker _[REF]()_ and how it leverages _"containerisation"_ to achieve straightforward deployments of development environments.


## 1.4 Project Management
The project followed the methodology of the Unified Process (henceforth UP) framework _[REF]()_. Given the circumstances of two-thirds of the technologies being familiar to the author, whereas the blockchain aspect was almost entirely new ground, implementing **TODO: model x** made the most sense for the project.  
Given the limited amount of time available for a project of these dimensions, along with the research and experimentation required to validate whether the described goals were even achievable, user requirements were captured using a heuristic of what the essential functionality would be for the client-side application, and thus the API in general, in order for a user to create, manage and discuss their open tasks with their team. This was done by utilising the MoSCoW categorisation scheme _[REF]()_.  

The system was at first modeled with a theoretical deployment diagram in order to gain an understanding of which technological entities were required to neatly encapsulate responsibilities. Sequence diagrams were then used for more complex client-server-blockchain interactions at each new stage of the UP, where a new stage usually took the form of defining and implementing a new domain of the API, e.g. task management or user management.  

During the implementation stage of the project, a daily log was kept of the key advances and issues encountered during that day of development. This served as a useful tool to summarise the progress made, as well as providing an immediate opportunity to document issues that were encountered.

As the API continued to grow laterally, adding an array of endpoints for each new domain, unit testing the API's public functions became an essential part of the project workflow. Due to the primitive error handling of the still very young Solidity programming language (used to construct smart contracts for blockchains), any responses coming from the blockchain had to be rigorously tested server-side in order avoid silent breakages and regressions.
