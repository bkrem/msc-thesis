# Introduction
This user manual provides instructions on how to use QuantiTeam's mobile app, which serves as a basic showcase of the system's current features and its API in the context of a real application.  

# Registration
## Login
Upon opening the app, the user is greeted with QuantiTeam's login view. If the user has previously created an account in the QuantiTeam blockchain, they can simply enter their username and password, followed by a tap on "Login" to be forwarded to their task overview. If the login fails for any reason, the user is informed via dialog window.

## Signup
If this is the first time using QuantiTeam, the user can tap on "Sign up here" under the login form. This forwards the user to a signup form, requiring details such as a name, email, username, and password. Once the user is happy with their entries, tapping "Sign up" will validate the entered information. If mandatory fields have been left blank, the app will notify the user by marking them red. If the entered username is already taken or the entered passwords don't match, the user will be informed via a dialog window.


# Team
## Creating a Team
Using the navigation bar at the bottom of the app, the user can navigate to the "Team" tab. If the user is currently not part of a team, the main view will contain instructions on how to create a team. By tapping "Create Team" in the app's header, the user is forwarded to a simple text entry where they can enter their chosen team name and tap "Create Team" again.  
After a short delay to a account for the event being registered in a transaction block within the blockchain, the user should receive confirmation whether creating the team succeeded.

When navigating back to the team overview tab, the user should now see their team's details, as well as a list of team members. Instead of "Create Team", the header now contains an "Add Member" action button.

## Adding Members
To add a member to their team, a user can tap "Add Member" in the header of the app's "Team" tab. This forwards the user to a text entry where they are able to enter the username of another QuantiTeam user. After entering a username, the user taps the "Add Member" button and, after a short delay to register the transaction in the blockchain, receives confirmation whether adding the user to their team was successful or not.

When navigating back to the team overview tab, the user should now see the new member in the list of team members.
